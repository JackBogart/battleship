## Battleship!

### Todo

- Populate the grids with ships using predetermined cords.
- Set up event listeners on each cell
- Create render methods on the view object
- Bind listeners to controller methods that call appropriate methods in the
  view and model
- Redesign the page layout. Currently it uses a very generic layout that I made
  on a whim.

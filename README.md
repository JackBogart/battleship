## Battleship!

### Todo

- Final UI review
  - Add messages about type of ship sunk
    - Maybe a smaller message above the status saying what happened?
    - Need to consider how it will look for computer games, should have a
      timeout set while the computer 'decides'
- Clean up the README to show off the project

### Stretch Goals

- Add feedback for failed rotation attempts, make the ship(s) preventing
  rotation blink red?

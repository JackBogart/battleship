## Battleship!

### Todo

- Add dark mode
- Final UI review
  - Add messages about type of ship sunk
    - Maybe a smaller message above the status saying what happened?
    - Need to consider how it will look for computer games, should have a
      timeout set while the computer 'decides'
  - Finalize planning modal
    - Add a title + info on placement
  - Feedback for users hovering over tiles they can attack?
- Improve AI
  - Can add all adjacent cells to a queue when an attack is a hit
- Clean up the README to show off the project

### Known Bugs

- Look into why drag and drop API cursors aren't appearing without CSS

### Stretch Goals

- Add feedback for failed rotation attempts, make the ship(s) preventing
  rotation blink red?

## Battleship!

### Todo

- Add custom form validations
- Implement two player mode
  - Adjust rendering to account for two player mode
- Add dark mode
- Options menu to change site theme color?
  - This isn't required at all but would be kinda cool
- Add messages about type of ship sunk
  - Not sure how to do this in a way that looks good. Currently I've moved this
    to the bottom but the idea might be dropped. Need to brainstorm.
- Clean up the README to show off the project
- Look into why drag and drop API cursors aren't appearing without CSS
- Re-examine the drag and drop system, should we remove and create or adjust?
- Add feedback for failed rotation attempts, make the ship(s) preventing it blink
  red?
- Improve AI?
- Refactor control/view logic
  - Can probably abstract a lot of the view, exposing methods for each view
    (view meaning stage of the game) as needed, and methods related to action
    listeners.
- Final UI review

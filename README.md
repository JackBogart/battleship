## Battleship!

### Todo

- Review drag and drop implementation
- Implement two player mode
  - Adjust rendering to account for two player mode
- Redesign the page layout. Currently it uses a very generic layout that I made
  on a whim.
  - Add ability to set name
- Add dark mode
- Options menu to change site theme color?
  - This isn't required at all but would be kinda cool
- Add messages about type of ship sunk
  - Not sure how to do this in a way that looks good. Currently I've moved this
    to the bottom but the idea might be dropped. Need to brainstorm.
- Clean up the README to show off the project
- Look into why drag and drop API cursors aren't appearing without CSS
- Re-examine the drag and drop system, should we remove and create or adjust?
- Bug with chrome where after rotating, drag doesn't work first try?
  - Need to investigate

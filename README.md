## Battleship!

### Todo

- Implement drag and drop system
- Implement two player mode
  - Adjust rendering to account for two player mode
- Redesign the page layout. Currently it uses a very generic layout that I made
  on a whim.
  - Add ability to set name
- Add dark mode
- Options menu to change site theme color?
  - This isn't required at all but would be kinda cool
- Add messages about type of ship sunk
  - Not sure how to do this in a way that looks good. Currently I've moved this
    to the bottom but the idea might be dropped. Need to brainstorm.
- Clean up the README to show off the project

## Battleship!

### Todo

- Add messages about type of ship sunk
- Add ability to set name
- Implement drag and drop system
- Polish the intelligence of computer moves
- Implement two player mode
- Redesign the page layout. Currently it uses a very generic layout that I made
  on a whim.
- Add dark mode
- Options menu to change site theme color?
  - This isn't required at all but would be kinda cool
